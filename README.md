# Computer Vision Project - 3D Reconstruction using Kinect V2 
The working files will be updated on 16 April 2018

# Purpose
The objective of the last practical session is to perform 3D reconstruction using a pair of Kinect V2 camera.

# Task
* You have been familiarized with Kinect V2 and the technology behind it.
* We acquired data from Microsoft Kinect V2 for Windows using MATLAB and you experienced how to interact with the RGB camera and 3D depth sensor.
* For this project, you will be given a series of color and depth image pairs (most of them were acquired for calibration purpose, the last pair corresponds to the scene to reconstruct using a point cloud).
* A point cloud (in the 3D world reference frame) is a way to represent the external surface of an object.

# Submission
Your work is now to complete the following tasks:
1. Calibrate the two RGB cameras using the checkerboard calibration technique.
* Detect the corner points of the checkerboard
* Calibrate each camera separately (to get intrinsic parameters)
* Calibrate one camera with respect of each other(to get extrinsic parameters)
